  "summary": "The diff adds cPanel-oriented static assets (a public DEPLOYMENT.md and an optional public .htaccess). However, based on the truncated documentation content shown, several REQ-4/REQ-6 acceptance-criteria items are not verifiably present in the new docs from the provided diff summary. REQ-5 appears plausibly addressed by placing DEPLOYMENT.md under frontend/public, but footer-link behavior and build-output verification are not directly evidenced beyond that.",

      "reason": "The newly added frontend/public/DEPLOYMENT.md is truncated in the diff summary and only shows the beginning (Overview/Architecture). The required detailed cPanel upload paths (primary vs addon/subdomain), explicit BASE_URL instructions for subdirectory hosting, verification steps, and troubleshooting are not visible/confirmable from the provided excerpt.",

      "reason": "A ready-to-upload .htaccess file is added, but the documentation excerpt shown does not include placement instructions or guidance for unsupported directives (beyond a brief comment inside .htaccess about deleting it if 500 errors). The required doc guidance is not confirmable from the provided truncated DEPLOYMENT.md content.",
