  "summary": "Backend adds an `ensureUserRole` method and frontend calls it after login and before saving profiles, which likely resolves the profile-save deadlock via the new bootstrap path. However, the backend still enforces `#user` for `saveCallerUserProfile` and `getCallerUserProfile` without any automatic first-interaction grant, and an always-noop migration file was added despite no demonstrated state upgrade need. Diff summary also indicates multiple unrelated frontend changes (legal text removal, styling/theme/config/docs) not requested in the BuildRequest.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Automatically grant the '#user' role to any authenticated caller on first login (or first authenticated interaction) so newly authenticated users can save their profile without pre-existing roles.",
      "reason": "The backend still traps in `saveCallerUserProfile` and `getCallerUserProfile` when the caller lacks `#user`. The diff shows role assignment only occurs when the new `ensureUserRole()` method is called; there is no shown backend-side automatic grant on first authenticated interaction with existing endpoints (e.g., within `saveCallerUserProfile` or `getCallerUserProfile`).",
